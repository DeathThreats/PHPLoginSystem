# PHPLoginSystem &middot; [![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)]

PHPLoginSystem is a simple Login System created using PHP and MYSQL with Object Oriented Programming(OOP). It will serve as your 'boilerplate' so you don't have to write the code again and only make changes to its styling.

## Prerequisites

* [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
* Web Browser

## Instructions
* After downloading XAMPP, run it by pressing the Windows Key and search for **XAMPP Control Panel**, then start **Apache** and **MYSQL**
* Head to your browser and type in `localhost` it should display the default page premade by XAMPP
* Change the content of the page by deleting all files in **htdocs**. It is usually located in `C:\xampp\htdocs`
* Paste the files you got from doing `git clone https://github.com/DeathThreats/PHPLoginSystem.git`
* Head over to `localhost/phpmyadmin` and create your own database, then import my **users.sql** table in your database

## Note
* Only a few important server-side validations are included, feel free to create, modify, delete... the code to fit your needs.
* **It does not contain any styling** - there are two main reason, first, the main purpose is to provide a code that only contains the functionality of a login system. Second is to save time and effort, you will not have to remove my styles and add your own when you implement this in your own application.
